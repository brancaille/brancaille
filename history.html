    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Brancaille, also called brancaï, brancace, brancaziu, or Provençal pankration, is a traditional combat sport from southeastern France. It combines striking and wrestling, historically standing at the crossroads of folk wrestling and merciless duels. Often overshadowed by more regulated practices, this adult version of the loucho libre represents a darker facet of southern French sporting heritage. Eyewitness accounts depict a rough, infamous discipline that inspired modern pankration.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="origins">
    <h2>Origins: From Ancient Pankration to Medieval Christianization</h2>
    <p>According to tradition, pankration emerged around 2,500 years ago with the arrival of Greeks on the Provençal coast, during the founding of Massalia (Marseille) and Nikaia (Nice). This discipline, a direct descendant of Greek martial arts, was reinforced by the Romans. Pankration combined striking and grappling, with very few rules: everything was allowed except biting and eye gouging. Techniques included throws, submissions, and ground fighting, making it the ancient ancestor of modern mixed martial arts.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="roman-gaul">
    <h2>Practices in Roman Gaul</h2>
    <p>After Rome conquered Gaul in the 1st century BC, athletic festivals inspired by Greek traditions were introduced. Evidence in bronze statuettes and mosaics from Vienne, Orange, and Autun show local familiarity with pankration more than 1,000 years before the earliest Provençal records of 1351.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="christianization">
    <h2>Christianization and Medieval Disguise</h2>
    <p>Pankration was banned by Emperor Theodosius I in 393 CE as part of the Christianization of the Roman Empire. Seen as violent and pagan, it disappeared from public records in the West after 404. In Provence, the sport adapted, taking the name of Saint Pancras (“San Brancaille”) to cloak its pagan origins and continue as a cultural tradition. The term “brancaï” humorously means “the lame,” reflecting the brutal nature of the fights. Saint Pancras, martyred at fourteen, became a symbolic patron for wrestlers.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="clandestine">
    <h2>Clandestine and Medieval Practices</h2>
    <p>Between the 5th and 14th centuries, evidence of combat combining strikes and ground wrestling is scarce due to invasions, Christian prohibition of violent spectacles, and focus on armed combat. Nevertheless, clandestine or informal forms of mixed fighting persisted. From the 11th century, wrestling was integrated into martial training for pages and squires, combining strikes, throws, and grappling, and folk festivals occasionally escalated into “rough and tumble” matches.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="early-mentions">
    <h2>Early Historical Mentions</h2>
    <p>The earliest written references in Provence date from 1351, with Nîmes consular archives noting public wrestling competitions with prizes during the Nativity of the Virgin. Records in 1373, 1399, and 1483 confirm regular practice during religious and folk festivals, describing loucho styles: the loucho de la centuro en aut (standing wrestling) and loucho libro (free wrestling with ground fighting).</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="rules-techniques">
    <h2>Rules and Techniques</h2>
    <p>Brancaille allowed strikes tacitly approved by combatants, including punches, kicks, elbows, knees, headbutts, chokes, joint locks, and ground strikes. Unlike gentler folk wrestling, everything was tolerated: throws, pinches, bites, with no rounds until surrender or referee intervention. Fighters used a unique guard called the “fausse patte,” emphasizing speed and technique over brute force. Compared to modern MMA, brancaille favored slim, agile fighters, giving matches a fast-paced, ritualized aesthetic reminiscent of vale tudo or kickboxing in street-style arenas.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="modern-revival">
    <h2>Modern Revival</h2>
    <p>In the 1970s, Ernest Banon founded the Fédération des Luttes Traditionnelles Provençales. Two decades later, in 1990, Régis Renault established the French Association and the International Union of Pankration, drawing a clear distinction between modern pankration and its traditional form, while carefully avoiding any reference to the brancaille, which has a controversial past. Today, this traditional discipline continues to thrive within private clubs and clandestine competitions abroad, under the direction of Ghjuvanni Tramoni.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="legacy">
    <h2>Legacy and Contemporary Influence</h2>
    <p>Today, brancaille influences MMA and hybrid martial arts worldwide. Commercial adaptations exist in Europe, the Americas, and Asia, but the original clandestine practice continues under strict secrecy. Its enduring spirit reminds us that martial traditions are living, complex, and resilient across centuries.</p>
